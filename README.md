# ChallengeProjectOne

This is the Challenge project that is due on 04/03/2024.

Project requirements:
* Create a menu to log in with a username and password
* Display menu options
  
  * If the user doesn't enter something on the menu or is null then repeat the menu
  * take into consideration letter casing - uppercasing/lowercasing
  * passwords have casing, usernames don't (so convert to lowercase or something)
* When a successful menu option has been selected, then display some random text e.g option 1 is create member, just print member has been created
